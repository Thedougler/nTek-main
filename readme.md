# **What is nTek?** 
We hope to assist all the nerds out there who, like me, want there home to feel like it's straight out of the Jetsons. We will accomplish that whilst adhering to the following guiding principles.

- **Privacy First - Fully Local:**
Your privacy comes first. With nTek, all operations and control stay within your home network. No cloud dependencies, no prying eyes â€“ just you and your data. Our products are designed to work with Home Assistant, an open-source home automation platform that puts you in control.

- **High Performance and Craftsmanship:**
Were obsessive about uptime and reliability. Every nTek product is engineered for high performance, using quality components that stand the test of time.

- **Open-Source and Hackable:**
Transparency matters. You cannot trust what you cannot verify. You'll find the configuration, firmware, and design files for nTek products here in this repository. Consider it an open invitation to the curious minds and tinkerers out there. 

- **Plug and Play Ease of Use:**
Who said tech has to be complicated? Our plug-and-play ethos ensures that even if you're not a coding wizard, you'll have your nTek products up and running smoothly. We believe technology should solve problems, not create them.

- **Clean Minimalist Design:**
Taking cues from Dieter Rams, our products seamlessly blend into your living space unobtrusively. Technology should bring greater focus and clarity to the content, not distract from it.

- **This is a nerd's passion project:**
I'm not some massive corporation trying to calculate the most profitable methods of skimping on quality to maximize quarterly returns for shareholders. I'm just a nerd who wants to make cool stuff. I'm not going to cut corners to save a few bucks. I'm not going to use cheap components that will break in a year. I intend to make tech that I want to use myself and its a nice bonus if others want to use it too. Passion over profit is the name of the game here. As long as I can keep the lights on and the servers running, I'm happy.

- **Whats happens if your designs are stolen?**
I intend to take it as a compliment. If you want to go through the trouble of copying my designs and ordering parts, attaching them to a pcb or breadboard, then fitting that in an enclosure, and then flashing the firmware, and then configuring it to work with your home assistant, then more power to you. Probably easier and cheaper just to get my pre-made device though. I'm not going to waste my time and money on lawyers to try and stop you. I'm just going to keep making cool stuff and you can keep on copying it. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.

## **What were making right now**

### **[ MS1](devices/ms1.md)**
The MS1 is a multi-sensor that monitors your home's environment. It's a small, unobtrusive device that is packed with sensors. Here's what you can expect from the MS1:

- **Sensor Suite**: The MS1 is a versatile multi-sensor, featuring air temperature, humidity, luminance, motion detection, mmWave Radar, and Bluetooth Low Energy sensors.
- **Rapid Updates**: Each sensor updates at a minimum interval of 2 seconds, ensuring up to date insights into your home.
- **Zigbee Communication**: Integrated Zigbee radio with an integrated router handles seamless communication within your home regardless if the wifi works.
- **Power and Connectivity**: Power is supplied via USB, making it convenient to integrate the MS1 into your home.

**Future Versions:**
 While the MS1 marks our first step, we're already eyeing the horizon for more focused versions. 
- **MS1c** Equipped with local voice control powered by high-quality microphones and onboard AI acceleration. 
- **MS1b** Battery powered and equipped with deep sleep techniques, designed for those locations where a cable is just too ugly.
- **MS1s** Engineered for server rooms, the MS1s version supports Power over Ethernet, with optional Zigbee communication for Zigbee mesh routing.
