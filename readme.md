# **nTek**
We hope to assist all the nerds out there who, like me, want there home to feel like it's straight out of the Jetsons. We will accomplish that whilst adhering to the following guiding principles.

- **Privacy First - Fully Local:**
We're putting your privacy first. With nTek, all operations and control stay within your home network. No cloud dependencies, no prying eyes – just you and your smart home.

- **High Performance and Craftsmanship:**
Craftsmanship is in our DNA. Every nTek product is engineered for high performance, using quality components that stand the test of time. Expect nothing less than excellence.

- **Open-Source and Hackable:**
Transparency matters. That's why we're flinging open the doors to our codebase. In this repository, you'll find the configuration, firmware, and design files for nTek products. It's an open invitation to the curious minds and tinkerers out there.

- **Plug and Play Ease of Use:**
Who said tech has to be complicated? Our plug-and-play ethos ensures that even if you're not a coding wizard, you'll have your nTek products up and running smoothly.

- **Clean Minimalist Design Inspired by Dieter Rams:**
Aesthetics meet functionality with nTek's design philosophy. Taking cues from Dieter Rams, our products seamlessly blend into your living space – a marriage of form and function.

**[Introducing the nTek MS1: Initial Proof of Concept](ms1.md)**

Meet our first creation: the nTek MS1 It's an exploration of what's possible, a proof of concept that embodies our philosophy. Here's a snapshot of what the MS1 brings to your smart home:

- **Sensor Ensemble**: The MS1 is a multi-sensor wonder, featuring air temperature, humidity, luminance, motion detection, mmWave Radar, and Bluetooth Low Energy sensors.
- **Rapid Updates**: Each sensor updates at a minimum interval of 2 seconds, ensuring real-time insights into your surroundings.
- **Zigbee Communication**: Integrated Zigbee radio with an integrated router handles seamless communication within your smart home network.
- **Power and Connectivity**: Power is supplied via USB, making it convenient to integrate the MS1 into your setup.

**Future Versions**
While the MS1 marks our first step, we're already eyeing the horizon for more focused versions. Imagine the MS1c, equipped with local voice control powered by high-quality microphones and onboard AI acceleration. Or the MS1b, which stretches the battery life using deep sleep techniques – perfect for those locations where a cable is just too ugly.
